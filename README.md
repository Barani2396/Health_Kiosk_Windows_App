Description

A kiosk is a health monitoring device. In this project, an application was developed to interface with the kiosk module 
using Visual Studio and MS Access. This application could retrieve data from the kit and store it in a database. 
Primarily it stores data of the user's Blood pressure, Blood glucose, Body temperature, and Heartbeat. 
In addition, a login was provided to the users to view their health information. A similar application was also created 
for the doctors, to view and share medical data.
